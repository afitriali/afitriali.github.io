Kindness means, taking care of my body, mind and spirit in ways that it should be taken care of.
Kindness means, accepting my faults and not needing it to be different.

Learning means, acknowledging that I'm not at my best..
Learning means, actively seeking knowlege in ways that benefits myself and others.
Learning means, ready to make mistakes.

I want to be free.
Freedom means, free from the shackles of debt and towards financial independence.
Freedom means, not bound to one place, mentally or physically.
Freedom means, free from the need for others.

I want to be appreciative.
Appreciation means, being thankful for what I have.

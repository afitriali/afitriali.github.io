title: Meeting Fajrin Rasyid, Co-Founder of Bukalapak
---
I had the opportunity to meet and talk with Fajrin Rasyid, co-founder and CEO of Bukalapak, last week. It was on a breakfast meeting organised by young entrepreneur association Brunei (YEAB). A couple weeks before, I chanced a meeting with Fatin, the president of YEAB.

I’ve known Fatin through my friend and mentor, Huwaida. I’ve attended several coffee talks she organised when I was running my gym and later, my co-working space. It’s been a while since I put on my entrepreneurial hat and I wasn’t wearing it when I met her again. She invited me to the YEAB WhatsApp group.

I felt like I didn’t belong, an imposter. But if I am to be a full-time entrepreneur one day, I thought it’ll be good to surround myself with like-minded people. So I determined to join the first meeting that comes up, which happens to be this one with Fajrin Rasyid.

The table sat 15 of the most prestigious people in Brunei. Established and bright entrepreneurs. I didn’t do my research on Bukalapak as I had a CTF (Capture the Flag) competition the day before. My team had won second, yet on this table, I was unknown. I tried sticking with the organising committee lest my turn to sit next to Fajrin.

I was the first to return after filling my plate from the buffet. I chose a random seat and as luck would have it, Fajrin sat next to me. Vanessa from AgromIQ and Nurul from Benchlab joined in front of us. Great.

I first opted out from asking any questions and let Vanessa and Nurul lead the conversation. I eventually caved in and braved myself a few questions. Here’s what I learned:

- He had worked as a consultant for one year and decided that it wasn’t for Him. He said it is much more interesting for him to work on what turned into Bukalapak.
- When first designing the system, they focused on statistics. From experience, they knew it’s important to look at the numbers from the start.
- KPI should be the guideline for system design and delegation process.

I’ve also asked if there’s any person or books in particular that he sees as inspirations. He told me he tries to read 2 books a month. Vanessa asked if he puts conscious effort into writing his blog. Which inspired me to continue writing. Thus this blog.

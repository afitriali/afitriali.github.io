This is my 2020-2029 personal manifesto.

I want to be selfless. This does not mean placing others' need before mine, but given the choice, I must choose to give.
Giving means, providing time to listen and comfort others.
Giving means, supporting others financially towards their goal.
Giving means, thinking about others in ways that are beyond expected.

I want to be kind to myself.
Kindness means, taking care of my body, mind and spirit in ways that it should be taken care of.
Kindness means, accepting my faults and past and not wanting it to be other than what it is.
Kindness means, taking steps to change without judging myself on the reason for change.

I want to continue learning.
Learning means, acknowledging that I'm not at my best or that I'm the best in a room or group.
Learning means, actively seeking knowlege in ways that benefits myself and others.
Learning means, ready to be wrong.

I want to be free.
Freedom means, free from the shackles of debt and towards financial independence.
Freedom means, not bound to one place, mentally or physically.
Freedom means, free from the need for others.

I want to be appreciative.
Appreciation means, being thankful for what I have.
Appreciation means, being thankful for what I don't have.
Appreciation means, being thankful for the people around me.

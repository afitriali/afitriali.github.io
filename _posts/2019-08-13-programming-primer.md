Like any spoken language, programming language has its own syntax and semantics. This mean that it has its own set of vocabulary and sentence structure. Syntax or vocabulary are words that the computer understands. Semantics help the computer make sense of the instruction. A program or a script is a set of instructions. Sections or the whole of the program are codes.

To our predicament, computers are very particular on words and its arrangement. If we use the wrong words or if their arrangements are off by even a little, the program stops and throws an error. That is, if we’re lucky, sometimes, there‘s only silence.

But errors are not scary. They’re responses from the program, telling us, the programmer, what requires fixing — A bug. Debugging is the action of fixing this error.

When we speak, we anticipate response. A program response is an output from our instruction. Response may come in the form of information or action. As mentioned earlier, an error is also a response. It’s a way for a program to tell us that they cannot complete the instruction.

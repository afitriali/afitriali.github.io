Iâ€™ve got a new home for my thoughts. I made it simple to maintain and even simpler to read.

After moving between platforms, I decided on Jekyll and GitHub Pages. No servers, configurations, plugins and paywall. I designed the website to reflect this minimalistic approach. Inspired by Medium and taking it a step further, Iâ€™ve removed all the frills so my readers can focus on pure contents.

### Not only a new home, this is a fresh start.

I romanticised my history. Making sense of my past and retelling them in an idealistic light, when in truth, life isnâ€™t always that blatant. My stories had forged an identity. An identity my everyday-self struggle to match. So I removed them to make way for new stories, new growth.

May you be a family, friend or stranger, I invite you to come along in my writings, wherever it may bring you.

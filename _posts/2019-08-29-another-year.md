title: Another Year without Career Progression
---
Some of my peers were promoted today. I have been actively voicing out my wish for a career progression in recent years. When the news came out today and my name not in it, I felt a tinge of sadness. Do I feel like I deserve a promotion? yes. Realistically, I know others who work harder than me. But I also know for a fact that I've contributed in many areas throughout the years.

When my colleague asked if I'm sad, I shrugged it off. Honestly, it feels like missing a bus. Except the bus comes only every other year. Maybe my grief is not so much that I missed the bus. But the fact that I've literraly asked if there's anything I can do to get to the next level. I couldn't get a concrete answer. It is what it is.

It's easy to be egoistic. I'm not angry in that I feel I deserve better. It's the fact that my contributions and sacrifices are taken for granted. Say for example developing my skills in programming, project management, systems and security outside of company hours. And then actually using it in delivering my work. Or that I volunteer to go the extra mile in giving quality work. My writing, my analysis and especially my codes.

Maybe I misjudge my actual contribution. Maybe it's because I don't follow some company rules. Or that I don't work overtime. Maybe I need to pursue my calling. For many years, I seek for satisfaction outside of work. Freelancing, starting my own businesses. But it's tiring. Why don't I just quit and pursue these other goals if I'm so good?

I can taunt. And I know the choice is on my hand. Why should I go for the other options when I know things are fixable. If only we communicate. Which I did. I'm made a slave to my own insecurities and unwillingness. I'm sad because I could do more. And you could ask, why don't I just do?

I did and I could only do it for so long. I can keep jumping and waving my hands. Or I can just turn back and choose my own course. But I'm just a sayer and I'm tired and sad. At least I got what I have. Maybe next time.
